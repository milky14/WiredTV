A customizable TV Channel

This program is supposed to imitate a TV channel's behaviour.
You are supposed to download a bunch of shows or multiple series of your choice and
the program chooses, which one to play. Episodes are played in order.
Between episodes, program plays several ads and a bumper and continues with the show.

This project was originally intended to play on an external TV screen, but
it can be opened from your PC and should run just fine!

Have fun watching your own, customizable TV Channel!
